# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
For this analysis, we used a variety of supervised machine learning algorithms to predict whether loan customers were "high risk" or "low risk". We ran the data through six different machine learning algorithms, with the goal of finding which was the most effective for our purpose. Since, there are significantly more low risk loans than high risk loans we needed to use machine learning algorithms that alleviates this class imbalance. We used oversampling, undersampling, a combination of undersampling and oversampling, as well as emsemble methods.
